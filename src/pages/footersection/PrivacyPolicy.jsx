//         When you visit printmartshop, we automatically collect certain
//         information about your device, including information about your web
//         browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on
//         your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect
//         information about the individual web pages or products you view, what
//         websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact
//         with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as
//         “Device Information.” Moreover, we might collect the personal data you
//         provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address,
//         payment information, etc.) during registration to be able to fulfill the
//         agreement.

//       <h3 className="text-lg font-bold mt-4">Why do we process your data?</h3>
//       <p>
//         Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process
//         only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to
//         maintain the website. Information collected automatically is used only
//         to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical
//         information regarding website usage. This statistical information is not
//         otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify any particular
//         user of the system.
//       </p>
//       <p>
//         You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing
//         any information, by which someone could identify you as a specific,
//         identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
//         website’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide
//         other details by filling a form, you may provide personal data to us,
//         such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence,
//         organization, telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with
//         your personal data, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
//         some of the website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to
//         receive our Newsletter or contact us directly from the website. Users
//         who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are welcome to
//         contact us via{" "}
