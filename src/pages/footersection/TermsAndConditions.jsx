Any tax liability arising consequent to non-compliance of law or due to furnishing of incorrect GST registration number and the Entity name, if applicable shall be borne by the Member. In the event, if Member fails to furnish GST registration number at the time of placing the order, the Member will be treated as ‘unregistered’ and will not be able to avail any input tax credit.

                        In any case, the liability of 123techprint under GST regime would be limited to the amount of tax charged by 123techprint.
